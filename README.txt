The evaluation function adds between the:
        -score
        -highest tile
        -number of empty cells
        -number of cells which are the same as their neighbors
        -number of sorted rows
        -number of empty rows
    Each feature has a different weight in the linear combination.
    The importance of each feature is decided by the weight.
